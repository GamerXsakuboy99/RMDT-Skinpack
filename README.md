# Rockport Metropolitan skinpack

3rd time instalment of this pack is here with now more skins and details.

### Rockport universe
This skin pack is fully build for new universe, so these skins aren't part of V1 - V2.9 map releases as these maps are part of obsolete universe.
So these skins are part of upcoming V3 release.

### Support
Once more: Support is not provided for legacy maps (v1 - v2.9), but support is provided for this skin pack and all stuff released in future.

# Skins variations and workflow
* RPM/RPT has all parts: exterior, passenger saloon, cab.
* LVP only has exterior parts due ordering stock only with their livery.
